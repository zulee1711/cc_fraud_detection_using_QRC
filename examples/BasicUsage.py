# # Basic usage of SpinPulse

# %% [markdown]
# In this notebook, we present the basic usage of the `SpinPulse` package.
# We first show how to transpile a `qiskit.QuantumCircuit` into a `spin_pulse.PulseCircuit`.
# We then demonstrate how to use the `.to_circuit()` method to obtain a `qiskit.QuantumCircuit` that represents the initial circuit executed on spin qubits.
# The implementation of noise at the circuit level is then presented, and we conclude by studying the effect of dynamical decoupling.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Hardware Specs definition
# We begin by creating an ``HardwareSpecs`` instance that specifies the parameters of our spin-qubit quantum computer.
#
# See the `ParametrizingfromQPUSpecs` example for hardware specifications tailored to spin-qubit hardware.

# Then we specify a quantum circuit that we would like to implement and simulate.
# Here the circuit is simply made of a CNOT on the first two qubits, while the third qubit remains at rest.

# ## Gate transpilation
#
# The `gate_transpile` method from the `HardwareSpecs` class converts our circuit to an ISA circuit that is composed of the native gates of the spin qubit platform.
#
# This step is realized through pre-configured qiskit transpilers.

# %%
isa_circ = hardware_specs.gate_transpile(circ)
isa_circ.draw("mpl")

# %% [markdown]
# We obtain our transpiled circuit: `isa_circ` that is formally equivalent to the original one, i.e. they are described by the same unitary quantum channel, something that we can check using the module ``qiskit.quantum_info``:

# %%
from qiskit.quantum_info import Operator, average_gate_fidelity

# the transpilation process might modify the ordering between physical and logical qubits
# the function from_circuit takes into account the layout of the transpiled circuit to ensure consistent ordering
print(
    "Fidelity between circuit and ISA circuit:",
    average_gate_fidelity(Operator.from_circuit(circ), Operator.from_circuit(isa_circ)),
)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Pulse transpilation

# %% [markdown]
# We now compute the required pulses thats implement `isa_circ` by parameterizing the Hamiltonians of the spin-qubit model to construct the circuit.
#
# The `PulseCircuit` class performs this task based on the hardware specifications and automatically computes the pulse durations required to implement the rotation gates $R_{X,Y,Z}$ and $R_{ZZ}$ of the model.
#
# Note that, in this example, idle times are automatically inserted to synchronize the qubits at each circuit layer.

# %%
from spin_pulse import PulseCircuit

pulse_circuit = PulseCircuit.from_circuit(isa_circ, hardware_specs)
pulse_circuit.plot(hardware_specs=hardware_specs)

# %% [markdown]
#
# In this illustration, the red pulses correspond to single-qubit gates driven by an oscillating magnetic field, while the blue pulses correspond to two-qubit gates implemented via a $J$-coupling (Heisenberg) pulse. The delta (z) ramp defined in the gate is also shown in blue.
#
# The pulse shapes are Gaussian for both the oscillating magnetic-field drive and the $J$-coupling pulse, as specified in the hardware configuration.
#
# Pulse durations and amplitudes are determined from the hardware specifications provided when initializing the `HardwareSpecs` object.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Numerical integration
#
# The function `to_circuit` integrates these pulses to obtain the implemented circuit as a sequence of unitary matrices representing each gate. This is the standard way to represent a quantum circuit, in particular using the class qiskit's ``QuantumCircuit`` that we use here.

# %%
implemented_circ = pulse_circuit.to_circuit()
implemented_circ.draw("mpl", style="textbook")

# %% [markdown]
# Having such a gate-based description allows to use qiskit functions to evaluate directly some metrics, such as the fidelity with the original circuit.
# Here the fidelity deviates from unity to the presence of small non-adiabatic contribution in the realization of the two qubit gate. We provide the function ``pulse_circuit.fidelity`` to evaluate this metric directly from the pulse circuit.

# ## Noise-Accurate Simulations
#
# An experimental environment can be initialized using the `ExperimentalEnvironment` class.
#
# Here, we define the noise as `PINK`, which is an important noise characteristic of spin qubits, with a coherence time $T_2^* = 500$.
#
# We also set the total duration of the time trace to `duration = 2**15`, equal to the native time `segment_duration = 2**15`.
#
# The parameter `segment_duration` because it determines the frequency components present in the signal.
#
# Attaching an experimental environment to a pulse circuit introduces noisy time traces on each qubit.
#
#

# ## Switching to square pulses
#
# Through a simple argument change, we can change the shapes of our pulses from Gaussian to Square, and repeat the same calculations.

# ## Dynamical decoupling
#
# Finally, the ``dynamical_decoupling`` optional argument in the ``HardwareSpecs`` constructor allows to replace idle sequences by single-qubit rotations, in order to protect the qubit from the low frequency part of the time traces  (the high-frequency part being still present and affecting coherence).
